        <h2>A little about me ðŸŒ±</h2>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Khae â€” a Burmese artist currently based in Paris. I spend my days painting outdoors, biking
          through
          the city566 with my bike Noe, and following whatever small thing catches my eye â€” a shadow, a fallen leaf, the
          way
          the light hits a wall.</p>
        <p>I studied at Ã‰cole Ã‰mile Cohl in Lyon, where I deepened my love for visual storytelling, traditional media,
          and
          the French language. These days, I work mostly with gouache, drawn to soft colors, greenery, flowers, and
          peaceful, fleeting moments. My work is often about the quiet details that feel important â€” even if we canâ€™t
          quite explain why.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a deep feeler and a little impulsive â€” happiest when Iâ€™m collecting things I love: scraps, receipts,
          pressed flowers, memories. I journal a lot (I forget things easily) and collect notebooks obsessively, filling
          them with thoughts, sketches, and pieces of my days.</p>
        <p>I love music that makes me feel everything, movies that make me cry, and solo cinema trips. I find comfort in
          simple things â€” nature, Studio Ghibli films, the warmth of green, and the soft magic hidden in everyday life.
        </p>
