      <h2>A little about me ðŸŒ±</h2>

      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Khae â€” a Burmese artist currently based in Paris. I spend my days painting outdoors, biking through
        the city with my bike Noe, and following whatever small thing catches my eye â€” a shadow, a fallen leaf, the way
        the light hits a wall.</p>

      <p>I studied at Ã‰cole Ã‰mile Cohl in Lyon, where I deepened my love for visual storytelling, traditional media, and
        the French language. These days, I work mostly with gouache, drawn to soft colors, greenery, flowers, and
        peaceful, fleeting moments. My work is often about the quiet details that feel important â€” even if we canâ€™t
        quite explain why.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m a deep feeler and a little impulsive â€” happiest when Iâ€™m collecting things I love: scraps, receipts,
        pressed flowers, memories. I journal a lot (I forget things easily) and collect notebooks obsessively, filling
        them with thoughts, sketches, and pieces of my days.</p>

      <p>I love music that makes me feel everything, movies that make me cry, and solo cinema trips. I find comfort in
        simple things â€” nature, Studio Ghibli films, the warmth of green, and the soft magic hidden in everyday life.
      </p>
